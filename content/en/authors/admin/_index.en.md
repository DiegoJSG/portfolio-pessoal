I am a professional with more than eight years of experience in the production of pasta and biscuits, acquiring skills in processes, quality, teamwork, safety and logistics. In 2022 I decided to start the career transition to the world of technology, especially in data science where I completed intensive programs in the area by Alura (in partnership with Grupo BoticÃ¡rio) and DIO (in partnership with iFood), acquiring language knowledge in Python, SQL, knowledge in BI, analytics, visualization and data modeling,  in addition to  machine learning techniques. My goal is to apply this knowledge to develop innovative and efficient solutions, contributing to my personal and professional growth and to the tech sector as a whole.
